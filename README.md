# Apps Script Automation

Most of boring and tedious work can be automated using code. I decided to spend some time to go through the Google Apps Script tutorials (https://developers.google.com/apps-script/articles/tutorials).

## 1. Creating Google Documents
## 2. Custom Function for Spreadsheets
## 3. Sending Emails
## 4. Removing Duplicate Rows in Spreadsheets
## 5. Handling Files in Google Drive
## 6. Generating Google Slides From Images
